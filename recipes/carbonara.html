    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Carbonara is another iconic Roman pasta dish that exemplifies Italian culinary mastery through simplicity, 
        requiring just four ingredients: pasta, guanciale, egg yolks, and Pecorino Romano cheese, 
        finished with freshly cracked black pepper. Often called "Italian bacon and eggs," 
        this beloved comfort food achieves its signature silky creaminess not through cream or butter, 
        but through the careful emulsification of eggs with hot pasta water and rendered guanciale fat, 
        creating a luxurious sauce that coats each strand perfectlyâ€”making it a technical yet rewarding dish 
        that transforms humble ingredients into pure indulgence.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Spaghetti (or rigatoni)</li>
            <li>Guanciale (cured pork jowl), diced</li>
            <li>Fresh egg yolks (whole eggs work too)</li>
            <li>Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Salt (for pasta water)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook pasta</strong> in salted boiling water until just before al dente, reserve pasta water</li>
            <li><strong>Crisp guanciale</strong> in cold pan over medium heat until fat renders and meat is crispy</li>
            <li><strong>Make egg mixture</strong> - whisk eggs, grated pecorino, and black pepper in bowl</li>
            <li><strong>Temper eggs</strong> - add splash of pasta water to egg mixture to prevent scrambling</li>
            <li><strong>Combine off heat</strong> - add drained pasta to guanciale pan, remove from heat, quickly stir in egg mixture</li>
            <li><strong>Emulsify</strong> - toss vigorously, adding pasta water as needed until creamy</li>
        </ol>

        <p><em>Key tip: Always remove pan from heat before adding egg mixture to prevent scrambling - the residual heat will gently cook the eggs into a silky sauce</em></p>
