    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Cacio e pepe is a classic Roman pasta dish that translates to "cheese and pepper," made with just three simple ingredients: 
        pasta (traditionally spaghetti), freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and coarsely ground black pepper. 
        The magic lies in the technique – the starchy pasta cooking water is used to create a silky, 
        creamy sauce that coats each strand without any cream or butter, transforming humble ingredients into one of Rome's most beloved comfort foods.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>Whole black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook pasta</strong> until aø dente, reserve 1 cup pasta water before draining</li>
        <li><strong>Toast peppercorns</strong> in a pan for 2-3 minutes, then grind coarsely</li>
        <li><strong>Make sauce</strong> by whisking grated Pecorino Romano with cooled pasta water (about 150°F) until smooth</li>
        <li><strong>combine</strong> hot pasta with cheese mixture, toss vigorously off heat until creamy</li>
        <li><strong>Serve immediately</strong> with extra cheese and pepper</li>
    </ol>

    <p><em>Key tip: Let the pasta water cool to 150°F before mixing with cheese to avoid lumpy sauce</em></p>
