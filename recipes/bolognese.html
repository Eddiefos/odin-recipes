    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Spaghetti Bolognese, more authentically known as Ragù alla Bologn Ragù Bolognese Sauce, 
    is a traditional Italian meat sauce from Bologna that's slow-cooked for hours to develop its rich, 
    complex flavors. Made with ground beef (or a mix of beef and pork), finely diced vegetables 
    (carrots, celery, onions), pancetta, wine, milk, and surprisingly minimal tomato, 
    this hearty sauce is built on patience rather than ingredients. 
    Traditionally served with fresh tagliatelle or pappardelle—not spaghetti, 
    despite its popular name—the sauce clings beautifully to wide, flat pasta, 
    creating the ultimate comfort food that embodies the soul of Italian cooking through its dedication to time and technique.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef (or beef/pork mix)</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sauté vegetables</strong> - Cook diced pancetta until fat renders, add onions/carrots/celery until softened</li>
        <li><strong>Brown meat</strong> - Add ground beef, cook until browned and water evaporates</li>
        <li><strong>Add wine</strong> - Pour in wine, cook until evaporated</li>
        <li><strong>Add tomatoes</strong> - Stir in tomato paste, cook briefly</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer low and slow</strong> - Add stock to cover, simmer covered 1 hour, then uncovered 2+ hours</li>

    </ol>
    <p><em>Key tip: Authentic Bolognese must be slow-cooked for at least 3 hours total - there's no such thing as a quick Bolognese</em></p>
